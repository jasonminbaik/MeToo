#### Examined whether social media movements, such as the #Metoo movement, are effective in informing and engaging a 
#### broader network of the population on a social issue, or if they serve as an echo chamber for those already in 
#### support of an issue to express their support and opinions.

#### Analyzed the content of Twitter posts, around the #Metoo period, to compare the topics shared by users who reported
#### a sexual assault or harassment incident to a sample of random users.

#### Conducted bigram analysis on Twitter text data to heuristically determine the topics that were discussed and whether 
#### the changes in topics were observed in both of the samples.

#### Utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a statistical machine learning algorithm, to cluster co-occurring words 
#### into topics for analysis with Python.
